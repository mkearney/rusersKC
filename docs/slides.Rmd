## Some background
**Research interests**
- How do people navigate political information in digital media
  environments?

**Problems**
- Social media use is hard to measure
- People are no good at recalling exposure to political media <span
  class="cite">(Prior, 2010; Prior, 2015)</span>

**New data sources**
- Real-time and digital-sources of data

## Issues in COMS research

- Generalizability of student samples
- Attrition in longitudinal [panel] studies
- Real-time/tracking equipment is expensive
- Limitations in self-report/questionnaire data
- Looming questions about replicability

---

## "Replication crisis"
- Recent discovery that most attempts to reproduce previous scientific
  research fail.
- Originated in psychology, but applies to all social science.
- There are a lot of potential causes, but people like to agree on 2
  in particular...

---

## 1. p-hacking
- **p-hacking** refers to systematic biases favoring significant (e.g., p
  < .05) results in analysis and peer review stages of research
- Result of p-hacking is literature with:
  - many reported false positives
  - few reported null [debunking] findings

---

## &nbsp;

---

## 2. Open data
- Replication crisis says more about documenting the scientific
  process than the validity of previous findings
- Leading cause of replication failure has been poor documentation
  - unpublished data
  - missing or misnamed variables
  - ommitted procedures

<h1 class="mytransition">Technological advances present new
<u>challenges</u> to communication researchers.</h1>

---

## New challenges
- Fragmented media audiences and probability sampling
- Respondent fatigue/information overload
- Increasingly salient privacy concerns

--- .transition

## &nbsp;

<h1 class="mytransition">Technological advances present new
<u>opportunities</u> to communication researchers.</h1>

---

## Big data
- **Big data** refers to "datasets  that  are  too  large  for
  traditional data-processing systems and that therefore require new
  echnologies" <span class="cite">(Provost & Fawcett, 2013, p. 54)</span>
- "Big data" isn't really that different from "small data"
  - It has rows, more columns, or more rows and more columns

---

## Dealing with big data

- The phrase "big data" **is** useful as a heuristic for new digital
sources of data
- New sources of data tend to be plentiful and less structured
- To deal with new digital sources of data, scholars have begun
  turning to **data science**

---

## Data science
- **Data science** is "a set of fundamental principles that  support  and
  guide  the  principled  extraction  of  information  and  knowledge
  from  data" <span class="cite">(Provost & Fawcett, 2013, p. 52)</span>
- More practically, data science combines both quantitative
  statistics and computer science methods

data science tools and methods.</h1>

## Better samples

- Convenience samples of students tend to be homogenous and
  limited in size
- Digital sources are not restricted by geography and can be massive
- In a few hours, one could, for example, stream a million tweets
  from the U.S.

---

## Better samples
- Digital [online] sources of data can be gathered across space and
  time
- Scholars often criticize these samples because they
  "are not representative of the general population"
  - But people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
- Internet activity correlates strongly with people activity

## Bigger questions
- Big data and data science make it possible to conduct research on a
  larger and more dynamic scale
- For example, one could collect tweets about political candidates
  daily and analyze change in sentiment over time

--- .sentanalysis

---

## Research questions
- Measurement error is not always a problem, but sometimes it is
- Data science makes it possible to examine phonomena without
  measurement error
- For example, people tend to overestimate the degree to which their
  social media networks are politically heterogeneous

## User networks
- In my dissertation, I tracked user networks on Twitter during the
  2016 election
- Republican group: users who followed one or more of the following:
  - Sean Hannity, Sarah Palin, Fox News Politics, and Drudge Report
- Democrat group: users who followed one or more of the following:
  - Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman, HuffPost Politics, and Salon

## Network analysis
- Network analysis makes it possible to more accurately create a
  visual depiction of network clusters
- The degree to which Twitter networks are organized by partisanship
  is especially striking when examined via network analysis

<h1 class="mytransition">Communication researchers have an obligation
to use data science.</h1>

---

## Big data baggage

- In addition to computational demands, big data creates new ethical
  concerns for researchers
- Data science is becoming the intersection of prediction-centered
  **machine learning** and theory-centered **statistics** <span
  class="cite">(Vasant, 2013)</span>
- To better understand these two approaches, it helps to compare the
  goals of statistics with the goals of computer science

---

## Two approaches

**Computer science** examines whether a certain pattern can be found
  in data.
  - *e.g., hey Alexa, what is the capital of Chile?*

**Statistics** examines whether data can be found in a certain
  pattern.
  - *e.g., lack of sleep correlates with decreased cognitive
    performance*

---

## Two approaches

- Statistics, more than computer science, is condusive to knowledge
  discovery <span class="cite">(Vasant, 2013)</span>
	- Computer science provides tools for summarizing and subsetting
      "databases"
	- Statistics provides tools for testing and creating theories
      with "data frames"

---

## Competing models

- Quantitative statistics models are judged by their explanatory
  potential
- Machine learning models are statistical models judged solely by
  accuracy of their predictions
  - If we had 100 cases of data, then we would fit a model on 50 of
	those cases and test the model on the other 50 cases
- Predictive models do not *explain* what is happening
  - Impossible to know whether variables in model actually reflect
    some underlying construct <span class="cite">(Vasant, 2013)</span>

---

## Machine learning problems
- Machine learning is agnostic toward theoretical considerations,
  which leads to at least 2 problems
  - Predictive models can be misinterpreted as explanatory, e.g., racial profiling
  - Algorithms can be manipulated <span class="cite">(Verge, "Twitter
  taught Microsoftâ€™s AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a
  day", 2016)</span>

---

## Theory hangs in the balance
- Institutions will increasingly make decisions informed by data
  science
- The future of data science will be shaped by machine learning and
  statistics
- Communication researchers are uniquely suited to contribute
  to best practices of data science

---

## Communication studies

- Communication studies is a natural fit for data science
- Digital communication means "messages" can be directly captured
  using computational methods
  - So the "data" in data science is communication
- Methodological diversity in communication studies can provide
  insights to both applied and theoretical understandings of big data
  and data science
